# Day 1 - HTML

During this day, I created a simple webpage using only one html file. by the 40 min mark, I was about done playing around with all the features of
HTML, so I decided to cut my time short and call it a day. I have my attached HTML file, which I will be using in the preceding days to test my
skills in CSS and Javascript.
