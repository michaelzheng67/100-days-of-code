# Day 2 - CSS

Like yesterday, today I ended the session with around 20 minutes left since I felt like I explored a decent amount of CSS and didn't have much creativity left to
design more. Tomorrow, I will be doing Javascript, hopefully I can take the entire hour to make the webpage a lot better in terms of functionality and interactions.
