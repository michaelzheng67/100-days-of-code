# 100 Days of Code

---

In this repository, I will be posting my code written each day during my attempt at the 100 days of code challenge. What I will be doing is that each day of this challenge, I will time myself coding for an hour and post on here whatever I accomplish that day. Each day, I will try to either explore a technology that I previously did not, or try and iterate on the last day and dive deeper into it if need be (e.g learning a new framework). This repo is just meant as sort of a personal tracker so that I am motivated to continue doing this and can keep track of previous days and what I've already done. 

Some of the things I want to explore during this challenge include:

* I will mark these as completed as I progress *
