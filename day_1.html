        <p class="rainbow-text"> For my first day of the challenge, I decided to create a simple webpage.
            For day 2, I think I will work on CSS and actually make this page look (somewhat)
            cool. </p>
        
        <br>

        <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I'm not actually trying to make things "look good".
        I'm just playing around with different features to see how they would look.</p>

        <p>Some comparison of what heading sizes look like:</p>
        <h1>H1, obviously.</h1>
        <h2>H2, slightly smaller</h2>
        <h3>H3, smaller than that</h3>

        <ul>
            Unordered list of some of the things I like to do:
            <li>Play Basketball</li>
            <li>Code (when I'm motivated)</li>
            <li>Read different genre non-fiction books</li>
            <li>Long walks on the beach</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <ol>
            Ordered list of things that I don't like:
            <li>Thunder and Lightning</li>
            <li>Spiders</li>
            <li>Clowns</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <p> I'm starting to run out of ideas of what to write here. I'm just going to post 
            a picture of Warren Buffett that you can click on to bring you to his Wiki page:
