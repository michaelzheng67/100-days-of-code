# Day 3 - Javascript

Today, I tried to learn how to add javascript effects to my webpage. I played around a bit with animated canvas' that I found on the internet, and tried to 
understand how they were structured and created by the original programmer. I also designed a few of my own simple functions that would activate to events 
(e.g onmouseover, onclick, etc) to get a feel for how to integrate javascript to make a site more interactive. For the next few days, I think I will try out a 
few web dev frameworks and see if I can create anything tangible. If not, it will be a great learning experience since currently I don't have too much framework
experience outside of side projects.
