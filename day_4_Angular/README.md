# Day 4 - Angular Framework

For this day, I followed the tutorial on the official Angular Framework documentation website. I got a high level understanding of how to input and display data,
and hopefully for the next few days I continue to learn this framework and dive deeper into its syntax and semantics, and hopefully I can customize the page
instead of directly following the tutorial steps
